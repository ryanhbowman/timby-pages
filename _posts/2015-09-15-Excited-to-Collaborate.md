It’s been a long time coming but we’re finally taking on new projects! We’ve spent the last couple of years refining tools, weeding out bugs and doing a security overhaul.
 
News travels fast and we are now in talks with governments, human rights groups and environmental teams from across Africa, South America, Asia and the Middle East.

We’ve got tons of plans: other languages, a simpler icon-only based system, an iOS app, more security features, varied story-telling options, a gorgeous mapping experience and lots more.
 
We’d love for you to help us get there. If there’s something you think TIMBY can help you achieve – whether it’s monitoring abuse, the bug infestation at Burning Man, or addressing sexual violence on campus – drop us a line at info@timby.org. For more sensitive projects, please use the encryption key listed in the footer of our website.
 
We’ll pick a handful of excellent groups over the next 6-8 months to help us rework the TIMBY system to support different needs. We strongly believe that technology should adapt to how we think and work and that one tech solution doesn’t fit every system. We anticipate these steps will create useful options for other groups when we open the dashboard in the months to come.
 

**How to get involved**
 
There are a few different ways to get involved in the coming months.

Ultimately our mission is to keep this project free for the small but extraordinary groups worldwide that work tirelessly to make the world a better place. In order to achieve their goals – and to stay safe – these groups require security, hardware, hosting, detailed base maps, and ongoing technical support - all of which costs money.
 
If you are a small group/project like this, don’t hesitate to let us know your circumstances at info@timby.org. We’ll map out your workflow and if you need changes/hardware/training, we’ll do our best to rally the support we need to get you up and running.

If you are a larger organization, a government or a business and would like a custom build, extra security features or functionality, let us know. We’re doing talks around the world over the next few months and are available for demos at your workplace. Or, if you’ve got detailed base maps or shape files of concessions/infrastructure, consider donating them to TIMBY so that other groups can benefit. 
 
Finally, if you are a foundation or philanthropist, get in touch! We’ve got a growing list of amazing projects around the world that we need your help to get up and running. Let us know what you are interested in supporting and we’ll make it happen – info@timby.org.
