Every April, over 1000 of the world’s most influential social entrepreneurs gather at Oxford University for the ![Skoll World Forum](https://skollworldforum.org/).

This year TIMBY had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Sundance/Skoll Stories of Change team and work with some of the award-winning social entrepreneurs to tell their story.

On the TIMBY team, we’re focused on moving beyond data and statistics, literally connecting dots to create narratives – so this type of collaboration is really what moves us.  

Through the Forum, we’ve also met a bunch of different groups that we’ll work with over the next couple years – so stay tuned for the global expansion of TIMBY.
